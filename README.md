# HR-Employee-Analysis-Attrition


# Summary
The way I framed my work is as the following:

Data named  (HR-Employee.csv)  was pulled over from www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data via HD insight. I had to create a container within a cluster named human resource for data loanding. Then, a SQL hive script is created with Ambari in order to do some data cleansing and a some data aggregation steps. One the data is ready to use, we made a visualization for stack holders to deepen the insight in order to meet strategic objectives.
